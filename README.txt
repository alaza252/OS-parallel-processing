Project Objective: 
to visualize how scheduling algorithms run processes, including I/O. For this specific project, the main processing unit will be a raspberry pi, with an arduino playground being used for I/O when present, and to split processes when not. 

Goals:
to highlight the differences between scheduling algorithms
to show the process's current state
to show the process's estimated finish time
to show how the processes are being split up
allow the user to upload a program
